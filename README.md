# AIM LAB !!!

Feedback is much appreciated!

A fun little p5.js project I made, took about 20 hours of work approximately. The game is good to play with when you need to practice mouse movement, including several minigames that will be discussed.

## Aim Trainer: 
The objective of this game is to practice responsiveness along with mouse flick accuracy. You will need to traverse your mouse from one point to another (clicking if you need to), increasing your score each time. 

## Tracer: 
This game tests comfortability with mouse movement, as the aim is to follow a point, with many options for how the point moves across the game space.

## CPS Test:
This game simply tests the speed at which you can click your mouse.
